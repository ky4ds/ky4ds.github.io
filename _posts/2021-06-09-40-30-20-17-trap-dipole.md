I have 50 feet of room for an antenna at my QTH. I've tried endfed
halfwaves, random wires and fan dipoles and for various reasons, none of
these antennas will work for my operating situation.

My bands of interest are 40/30/20 and 17m. There aren't too many
multiband antenna designs or offerings for 40m and 20m, and include WARC
bands.

I've recently obtained my Extra license and while studying for the test,
realized that I had absorbed enough math to design a multiband trap
dipole for my length requirements. The basic process to design such an
antenna is this:

1. Pick the highest and next lowest band. For my project, this was 17m
   and 20m.
2. Determine how much loading (shortening) is required for the lower
   band.
    * Since my antenna was to be a full length on 17m, which is 85% the length of 20m, I wanted as little shortening as possible.
    * $${Dim_A}$$ = shortened length of dipole
        * $${Dim_A} = 98%$$
    * $${Dim_B}$$ = distance from center of feedpoint where traps will be located (on shortened antenna)
        * $${Dim_B} = 85%$$
    * These two values give me an inductive reactance of 200 ohms (will discuss calculating $$X_L$$ later):
        * $$X_L = 200ω$$
3. Calculate trap inductance, $$L$$, given $$X_L$$ and our upper
   frequency $$f$$, the frequency to be trapped (17m/18MHz in this
   case).
    *  $$L = \frac {X_L} {2πf} = \frac {200ω} {2π18Mhz} = 1.768μH$$
4. Calculate trap capacitance.
    *  $$C = \frac {1} {(2πf)^2L} = \frac {1} {(2π18MHz)^21.768μH} = 44.219pF $$
5. Revise capacitance based on what can be sourced. We can
   roll our own inductors from wire around wound on pvc couplers, but
   since I do not want to homebrew my own high-voltage capacitors, there
   seem to be two affordable options:
    * Surplus Soviet transmitting equipment on EBay (my preference).
    * Silver Mica capacitors in parallel. I haven't tried this, but it
      seems that 3 [$$150pF$$ 1kV silver mica capacitors][mouser] in
      series will provide a sufficient voltage rating for our antenna.
      Three capacitors in series will have three times the voltage
      rating and one third the capacitance of each capacitor.
        * At $1.78 each, capacitors for a pair of traps will cost $10.68.
    * 3 $$150pF$$ capacitors in series leaves us with a trap capacitance
      of $$50pF$$.
6. Recalculate inductance based on the sourcable capacitance.
    *  $$L = \frac {1} {(2πf)^2C} = \frac {1} {(2π18MHz)^50pF} = 1.564μH $$
