I have 50 feet of room for an antenna at my QTH. I've tried endfed
halfwaves, random wires and fan dipoles and for various reasons, none of
these antennas will work for my operating situation.

My bands of interest are 40/30/20 and 17m. There aren't too many
multiband antenna designs or offerings for 40m and 20m, and include WARC
bands. Being a relatively new CW operator, 30m is great to have when 20
and 40 are swamped with high-speed contesting traffic.

I've recently obtained my Extra license and while studying for the test,
realized that I had absorbed enough math to design a multiband trap
dipole for my length requirements.

## Design process

The basic process to design such an antenna is this:

1. **Pick the highest and next lowest band.** For my project, this was
   17m and 20m.
2. **Determine how much loading (shortening) is required for the lower
   band.**
    * Since my antenna was to be a full length on 17m, which is 85% the
      length of 20m, I wanted as little shortening as possible.
    * $${Dim_A} = \text{shortened length of dipole}$$<br />
        
        $${Dim_A} = 98\%$$
        
    * $${Dim_B} = \text{trap distance from feedpoint (on shortened antenna)}$$<br />
        * Since 17m is 85% of 20m, and our traps will be located at the end of the 17m section, this leaves us with:
        
        $${Dim_B} = 85\%$$
      
    * These two values give me an inductive reactance of 200 ohms (will
      discuss
      [determining inductive reactance](#determining-inductive-reactance)
      later):
      
        $$X_L = 200ω$$
        
3. **Calculate trap inductance in Henries.**
    * Calculate inductance, in Henries given inductive reactance and our
      upper frequency.  The frequency to be trapped (17m/18MHz in this
      case):
    
        $${X_L} = {2πfL}$$
    
    * Solving for L, we get:
    
        $$L = \frac {X_L} {2πf} = \frac {200ω} {2π18Mhz} = 1.768μH$$
    
5. **Calculate trap capacitance.** We will take the inductive loading
   coils and convert these into a parallel LC circuit, aka dipole traps.
    
    The formula for capacitive reactance is:
    
    $${X_C} = \frac {1} {2πfC}$$
    
    Since traps are parallel circuits, first set $${X_C}$$ equal to $${X_L}$$:
    
    $${X_L} = {X_C}$$
    
    $${2πfL} = \frac {1} {2πfC}$$
    
    $${LC} = \frac {1} {(2πf)^2}$$
    
    $$C = \frac {1} {(2πf)^2L}$$
    
    $$C = \frac {1} {(2π18MHz)^21.768μH} = 44.219pF$$
    
6. **Revise capacitance based on what can be sourced.** We can roll our
   own inductors from wire wound on pvc couplers, but since I do not
   want to homebrew my own high-voltage capacitors, there seem to be two
   affordable options:
    * Surplus Soviet transmitting equipment on EBay (my preference);
      these are large "ceramic" doorknob capacitors. These can be found
      by running a search for [K15Y capacitor on ebay][ebay]. I've had
      good results with 3.5kV rated doorknob capacitors.
        * 2 K15Y doorknob capacitors will cost between $5 and $10,
          before shipping.
    * Parallel silver mica capacitors. I haven't tried this, but it
      seems that 3 [$$150pF$$ 1kV silver mica capacitors][mouser] in
      series will provide a sufficient voltage rating for our antenna.
      Three of these capacitors in series will have three times the
      voltage rating and one third the capacitance of each capacitor.
        * At $1.78 each, capacitors for a pair of traps will cost
          $10.68, before tax and shipping.
    * 3 $$150pF$$ capacitors in series leaves us with a trap capacitance
      of $$50pF$$, which is probably close enough.
7. **Recalculate inductance based on the sourcable capacitance.**
    
    $$L = \frac {1} {(2πf)^2C} = \frac {1} {(2π18MHz)^2*50pF} = 1.564μH
    $$

Altogether, we have:

* $${Dim_A} = 98\%$$<br />
* $${Dim_B} = 85\%$$<br />
* $$C = 50pF$$<br />
* $$L = 1.564μH$$<br />

Our two-band 17m and 20m dipole (with very little loading on 20m) will
require two parallel circuit traps with a capacitance of $$50pF$$ and
inductance of $$1.564μH$$.

### Determining inductive reactance

#### Method A: K1PLP's Lookup Chart

I simply used the loading coil chart from Chapter 9 of the [ARRL Antenna
Book, Vol 2][antenna_book_vol2] to calculate $$X_L$$. See figure 9.51.
Given $${Dim_A}$$ and $${Dim_B}$$, the chart will tell you $$X_L$$,
inductive reactance for the traps. This chart is also available in an
article from Jerry Hall, K1PLP, in [QST magazine, September 1974][K1PLP]
(mentioned below).

I highly recommend ARRL's Antenna Book. Chapter 9 in particular has
several sections dedicated to dipoles and loading techniques. Here is a
link for the [full ARRL Antenna Book][antenna_book].

#### Method B: 66Pacific's Online Calculator

The math to calculate inductance, given $${Dim_A}$$ and $${Dim_B}$$ is
quite involved (from [QST magazine, September 1974][K1PLP]):

$${L_{μH}} = \frac{10^6}{68π^2f^2}\left\{\frac {\left[{ln \frac {24 ({\frac{234} {f}} - B)}{D}} - 1 \right] [(1 - \frac {fB} {234})^2 - 1]}{ \dfrac {234} {f} - B} - \frac {\left[ln{\frac {24(\frac {A} {2} - B)} {D}} - 1\right]\left[(\frac {\frac {fA} {2} - fB}{234})^2 - 1\right]} {\frac {A} {2} - B} \right\}$$

Where:

* $${L_{μH}} = \text{inductance required for resonance}$$<br />
* $$f = \text{frequency, megahertz}$$<br />
* $$A = \text{overall antenna length in feet}$$<br />
* $$B = \text{distance from center to each loading coil}$$<br />
* $$D = \text{diameter of radiator in inches}$$<br />

Fortunately, [66pacific.com][66pacific] has published a
[utility][coil-dipole-calculator] for this calculation.

One word of caution: it seems that calculator can very highly sensitive
to the total length of antenna in feet. For the 20m dipole, if you
select 31 total feet, coils 13.9 feet from center, 14awg wire, and an
operating frequency of 14Mhz, you get $${9.7μH}$$. For the same values,
but with 32 total feet, the calculator shows $${4.5μH}$$. At 14MHz, this
would correspond to 850ω for $${9.7μH}$$ and 395ω!

IMO, these calculations are too sensitive and our design needs more
fault tolerance than this; the doorknob caps may only be rated for 20%
accuracy, and the homebrew coils can be a pain to wind to a precise
inductance.

Rather, I would recommend doing the math and looking up $$X_L$$ from the
ARRL chart. It may be challenging to wind inductors for the exact value
of your calculation and knowing the reactance will make it easier to see
whether your traps are close enough or not.

### Another example: 10m/20m trapped and loaded dipole

Suppose we wanted trapped dipole for 20m and 10m and we wanted to
shorten the whole antenna by 25%. This would give us

* $${Dim_A} = 75\%$$<br />
* $${Dim_B} = 66\%$$<br />
    * per side, 5 meters for the 10m band
    * per side, an additional 2.5 meters for the 20m band
* $$X_L = 600ω$$<br />
    * as per K1PLP's chart
* $${L_{initial}} = \frac {X_L} {2πf} = \frac {600ω} {2π28.85Mhz} = 3.310μH$$<br />
* $${C_{initial}} = \frac {1} {(2πf)^2L}$$<br />
