I have 50 feet of room for an antenna at my QTH. I've tried endfed
halfwaves, random wires and fan dipoles and for various reasons, none of
these antennas will work for my operating situation.

My bands of interest are 40/30/20 and 17m. There aren't too many
multiband antenna designs or offerings for 40m and 20m, and include WARC
bands.

I've recently obtained my Extra license and while studying for the test,
realized that I had absorbed enough math to design a multiband trap
dipole for my length requirements.

## Design process

The basic process to design such an antenna is this:

1. **Pick the highest and next lowest band.** For my project, this was
   17m and 20m.
2. **Determine how much loading (shortening) is required for the lower
   band.**
    * Since my antenna was to be a full length on 17m, which is 85% the
      length of 20m, I wanted as little shortening as possible.
    * $${Dim_A}$$ = shortened length of dipole
        
        $${Dim_A} = 98\%$$
        
    * $${Dim_B}$$ = distance from center of feedpoint where traps will
      be located (on shortened antenna). Since 17m is 85% of 20m, and
      our traps will be located at the end of the 17m section, this
      leaves us with:
        
        $${Dim_B} = 85\%$$
      
    * These two values give me an inductive reactance of 200 ohms (will
      discuss
      [determining $$X_L$$](#determining-inductive-reactance-x_l) later):
      
        $$X_L = 200ω$$
        
3. **Calculate trap inductance $$L$$.** Calculate $$L$$ given $$X_L$$
   and our upper frequency $$f$$, the frequency to be trapped (17m/18MHz
   in this case).
    
    $$L = \frac {X_L} {2πf} = \frac {200ω} {2π18Mhz} = 1.768μH$$
    
4. **Calculate trap capacitance.** We will take the inductive loading
   coils and convert these into a parallel LC circuit, aka dipole traps.
    
    $$C = \frac {1} {(2πf)^2L} = \frac {1} {(2π18MHz)^21.768μH} = 44.219pF $$
    
5. **Revise capacitance based on what can be sourced.** We can roll our
   own inductors from wire around wound on pvc couplers, but since I do
   not want to homebrew my own high-voltage capacitors, there seem to be
   two affordable options:
    * Surplus Soviet transmitting equipment on EBay (my preference);
      these are large "ceramic" doorknob capacitors. These can be found
      by running a search for [K15Y capacitor on ebay][ebay]. I've had
      good results with 3.5kV rated doorknob capacitors. Capacitors
    * Silver Mica capacitors in parallel. I haven't tried this, but it
      seems that 3 [$$150pF$$ 1kV silver mica capacitors][mouser] in
      series will provide a sufficient voltage rating for our antenna.
      Three capacitors in series will have three times the voltage
      rating and one third the capacitance of each capacitor.
        * At $1.78 each, capacitors for a pair of traps will cost
          $10.68, before tax and shipping.
    * 3 $$150pF$$ capacitors in series leaves us with a trap capacitance
      of $$50pF$$.
6. **Recalculate inductance based on the sourcable capacitance.**
      
      $$L = \frac {1} {(2πf)^2C} = \frac {1} {(2π18MHz)^50pF} = 1.564μH $$

Altogether, we have:

$${Dim_A} = 98\%$$, $${Dim_B} = 85\%$$, $$C = 50pF$$, $$L = 1.564μH$$

Our two-band 17m and 20m dipole (with very little loading on 20m) will
require two parallel circuit traps with a capacitance of $$50pF$$ and
inductance of $$1.564μH$$.

### Determining inductive reactance, $$X_L$$

#### Method A

I simply used the loading coil chart from Chapter 9 of the [ARRL Antenna
Book][antenna_book] to calculate $$X_L$$. See figure 9.51. Given
$${Dim_A}$$ and $${Dim_B}$$, the chart will tell you $$X_L$$, inductive
reactance for the traps. This chart is also available in an article from
Jerry Hall, K1PLP, in [QST magazine, September 1974][qst] (mentioned
below).

#### Method B

The math to calculate inductance, given $${Dim_A}$$ and $${Dim_B}$$ is
quite involved (from [QST magazine, September 1974][qst]):

$${L_{μH}} = \frac{10^6}{68π^2f^2}\left\{\frac {\left[{ln \frac {24 ({\frac{234} {f}} - B)}{D}} - 1 \right] [(1 - \frac {fB} {234})^2 - 1]}{ \dfrac {234} {f} - B} - \frac {\left[ln{\frac {24(\frac {A} {2} - B)} {D}} - 1\right]\left[(\frac {\frac {fA} {2} - fB}{234})^2 - 1\right]} {\frac {A} {2} - B} \right\}$$

Where:

* $${L_{μH}}$$ = inductance required for resonance
* $$f$$ = frequency, megahertz
* $$A$$ = overall antenna length in feet
* $$B$$ = distance from center to each loading coil
* $$D$$ = diameter of radiator in inches

Fortunately,
[66pacific](https://www.66pacific.com/calculators/coil-shortened-dipole-antenna-calculator.aspx)
has published a utility for this calculation.

One word of caution: it seems that calculator can very highly sensitive
to the total length of antenna in feet. For the 20m dipole, if you
select 31 total feet, coils 13.9 feet from center, 14awg wire, and an
operating frequency of 14Mhz, you get $${9.7μH}$$. For the same values,
but with 32 total feet, the calculator shows $${4.5μH}$$.

Rather, I would recommend doing the math and looking up $$X_L$$ from the
ARRL chart. It may be challenging to wind inductors for the exact value
of your calculation and knowing the reactance will make it easier to see
whether your inductors are close enough or not.
