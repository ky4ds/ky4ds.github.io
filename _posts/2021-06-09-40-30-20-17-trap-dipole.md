I have 50 feet of room for an antenna at my QTH. I've tried endfed
halfwaves, random wires and fan dipoles and for various reasons, none of
these antennas will work for my operating situation.

My bands of interest are 40/30/20 and 17m. There aren't too many antenna
designs or offerings which work for the harmonically related and WARC
band
