This is a calculator to assist with designing a two band shortened trap
dipole. Prefilled values are for a 17/20m trapped dipole, with
loading removing only 2% of antenna length.

## Caveat

I have not yet built an antenna using these exact values, however these
values are close to alternative calculations I've done while designing
and building my first trap dipole (which was successful).

## Notes

When I built my trapped 17m/20m trapped dipole with \\(X-L = 200ฮฉ\\),
the 20m section was much shorter than I expected. That means my
inductance, and therefore my inductive reactance, was too high and
should have been lower.

It turns out my reactance was too high because I overshot the coil
distance from feedpoint. I calculated

\\(17m/20m = 85\%\\)

However, the proper calculation would have been

\\( \frac {143} {18.118MHz} รท \frac {143} {14.055MHz} = 77.58\%\\)

**It is very important to compute the amount to shorten and coil
distance and as accurately as possible**, since these inputs can produce
wide swings in inductive reactance, \\(X_L\\). Do not just go by band
meters! Instead, calculate precise values from exact frequencies.

As explained by CT1EOJ, the electrical height is difficult to measure.
Electrical height and wire diameter are inputs to the antenna wire
characteristic impedance, \\(Z_0\\). My intuition is that the Nano VNA
can accurately measure \\(Z_0\\). This would allow for more accuracy
using this calculator. I will update this page if I find out how to do
that. Regardless, neither wire diameter, nor electrical height seem to
have much impact on the final coil inductance.
